# Learn to Code HTML & CSS
Brought to you by Galvanize. Learn more about the way we teach at [galvanize.com](galvanize.com).

## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of web development, starting with HTML and CSS.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Setting up our computers for web development
* Overview of basic HTML concepts
* Overview of CSS concepts
* Playing around in the sandbox

#### Before you begin, a quick gut check:
* This course is for absolute beginners
* Feel free to move ahead
* Help others when you can
* Be patient and nice
* You will get through it!

## Step 1 (Initial Setup):

#### Downloading and installing:
* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com](chrome.google.com) )
* A text editor to modify your files (Recommend the Atom text editor: [Atom.io](atom.io))  

#### Using an online editor:
* Choose an online editor by clicking on one of the links below.
  * [codepen.io/pen/](https://codepen.io/pen/)
  * [jsfiddle.net/](https://jsfiddle.net/)
  * [repl.it/](https://repl.it/)    
    * language HTML, CSS, JS

## Step 2 (Get project files):
If NOT using an online editor then please download the files from GitHub like so:
1. Click on the green "Clone or download" button on the right hand side and choose "Download ZIP".
2. Locate your download zip file and move it to your desktop.
3. Extract the zip file (windows) or open it (mac).
4. Open your code editor then open the non-zipped folder.

If you ARE using an online editor:
1. Open your code editor.
2. Copy the contents of the index.html into the html block in your online editor.
3. Copy the contents of the main.css into the css block of your online editor.
> WARNING you "might" have to slightly edit the index.html and main.css to get it work properly in the online editors.  Even after editing it might not look "exactly right".

If you are having trouble downloading or using the zip file but still using a local editor:
1. Make a new folder on your desktop (name it something you will remember).
2. Open your folder in your editor.
3. Create 2 new files in your folder from your editor and call them index.html and main.css
4. Copy the contents of the index.html and main.css from the GitHub repository into your newly created files and save each file.

## Step 3 (Lesson time):
Click on each of the links below to learn about:
* [HTML basics](html_basics.md)
* [CSS basics](css_basics.md)

## Step 4 (Playtime, have fun and make the site yours):
* Try changing CSS values and see how they effect the site.
* Update SRC and HREF with urls and see what happens when you click on them
* Add youtube iframe tags and experiment with the settings.
* Add more links,  list items, text, pictures, etc.
* Think about how you would like:
  * to dynamically make changes to the site
  * what could buttons or drop-downs do to your site
  * what about changing the CSS per user, or per movie.
